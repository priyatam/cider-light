# Dot Emacs

My minimalist Emacs workflow optimized for programming in Clojure, Cljs, Js,
Sass, HTML5 and a multitude of textfiles including Markdown.

## Getting Started

Linux:

     sudo apt-get install emacs
     curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cask/cask/master/go | python
	 cask install

OSX:

    brew install emacs --cocoa --srgb brew linkapps Emacs
	brew install cask
	cask install
	
Clone this repo into ~/.emacs.d and start Emacs. If all goes well, your emacs is good to go
with all packages including the following:

- [Magit](https://github.com/magit/magit),
- [Flycheck](http://www.flycheck.org),
- [inf-clojure](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/inf-clojure) or [Cider](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider)
- [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), and many outstanding plugins
- [Helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm)

## References

I always wanted to learn Emacs. It was hard. Thanks to [Alex
Baronosky](https://github.com/AlexBaranosky), I started learning Emacs the hard
way in the winter of 2014. I'm not going back to any other IDE.
