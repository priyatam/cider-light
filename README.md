# Dot Emacs

My minimalist Emacs workflow optimized for programming in Clojure, Cljs, Js,
Sass, HTML5 and a multitude of textfiles including Markdown.

## Getting Started

Linux:

     sudo apt-get install emacs
     curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cask/cask/master/go | python
	 cask install

OSX:

    brew install emacs --cocoa --srgb brew linkapps Emacs
	brew install cask
	cask install
	
Clone this repo into ~/.emacs.d and start Emacs. If all goes well, your emacs is good to go
with all packages including the following:

- [Magit](https://github.com/magit/magit),
- [Flycheck](http://www.flycheck.org),
- [Cider](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider),
- [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), and many outstanding plugins
- [Helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm)

## Further Reading

I always wanted to learn Emacs. It was hard. Thanks to [Alex
Baronosky](https://github.com/AlexBaranosky), I started learning Emacs the hard
way in the winter of 2014. I'm not going back to any other IDE.

If you find my workflow useful, my cheatsheets and notes are being updated in
the [wiki](https://github.com/priyatam/emacs.d/wiki).
