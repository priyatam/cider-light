# Dot Emacs

My minimalist Emacs workflow, optimized for programming in Clojure, Cljs, Js,
Go, Sass, HTML5 and Markdown.

## Getting Started

Install the latest version of Emacs and symlink Emacs.app to `~/Applications`:

    brew install emacs --cocoa --srgb brew linkapps Emacs
	brew install cask
	cask install
	
Clone this repo (init.el), and start Emacs.

Pacakges: I recommend [Magit](https://github.com/magit/magit),
[Flycheck](http://www.flycheck.org),
[Cider](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider),
[FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), and many outstanding plugins
from a growing community of Emacs hackers on [Melpa](https://melpa.org/#/)

## Further Reading

I always wanted to learn Emacs. It was hard. Thanks to
[Alex Baronosky](https://github.com/AlexBaranosky), I started learning Emacs the
hard way in the winter of 2014. I'm not going back to any other IDE. 

If you find my workflow useful, my cheatsheets and notes are being updated in
the [wiki](https://github.com/priyatam/emacs.d/wiki).
