## Notes

In the emacs world, what does "meta" mean? (edited)

It just means like the Control key

Emacs comes from way back in the days on machines with more buttons

super, meta, ... more I forget

basically in practice on a Mac alt comes bound to Meta

this just means that C-c M-, pronounced "Control see, meta comma", means you hold control and press c, then hold alt and press ,
